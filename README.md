# NOTE: THE MAIN GAME (berzerk4py.py) MAY NEED TO BE COMPLETELY REWRITTEN TO RESOLVE ISSUES!! #

This is an open source code for my Berzerk clone of the Atari 2600 version.

Includes arcade sound effects and hand-drawn graphics by me.

The game is BUGGY!

As it is right now, the game runs but slows down considerably.
This version attempts to use threading to increase performance, but to no avail. It slows down to a crawl almost immediately.

The game, itself, was copyrighted back in the 1970s, so this is considered a FAN PROJECT.

It is NOT for commercial use.
It IS free to download.
It IS free to edit.
You may create your own branches if you wish.

Feel free to take a look. The master file is berzerk4py.py
You can execute the working program from DOS or BASH prompt with python (or python3) berzerk4py.py

There is a help screen that will teach you the simple play controls.

I will add a Wiki in the future for this project.
